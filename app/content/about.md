how to use the site
-------------------
Focus on questions about an actual problem you have faced. Include details about what you have tried and exactly what you are trying to do.

Not all questions work well in our format. Avoid questions that are primarily opinion-based, or that are likely to generate discussion rather than answers.

All questions are tagged with their subject areas. Each can have many tags, since a question might be related to several subjects. Click any tag to see a list of questions with that tag, or go to the tag list to browse for topics that interest you.

This site is created by *Joakim Sehlstedt*, student at BTH, Sweden. 

Joakim Sehlstedt resides outside of Oxford in England, where he has spent a number of years running his own business in the music and graphics production field. He has studied programming since the autumn of 2013 to start off his career in IT. The music and the graphics production has over time become more and more a pure artistic expression than for-profit business plans for Joakim. The plan is to generate income from programming contracts and the time between these create more space for the arts.
